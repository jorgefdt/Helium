# Helium3

### This site is under construction - some references being made to the original Helium web site.

Helium3 it's a forked project of the floating browser window by Jaden Geller.

Helium3 supports multiple windows as documents, each with their own
settings as well as global preferences such as playlists and history, and
supporting multiple windows via a Finder status icon menu.

Helium3 allows you to watch media, browse the web and do much more while
you stay productive. Your content will never fall behind your other
windows even as you switch tasks.

Helium3 supports a number of per window preferences such a auto-hide titling,
as well as a customizable translucency mode that allows you to simultaneously
see your content and your work, without intercepting mouse clicks when it's
translucent.  You have the ability to click, drag, scroll
behind your floating content. 

## Getting Started - Helium3

## Getting Started - Helium

Head over to http://heliumfloats.com and install the latest version of Helium.
If you don't already allow apps from unidentified developers, you'll need to
right-click and choose "Open" the first time you use the app (instead of
opening the app with a single click).
