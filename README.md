# Helium3

Helium is a floating browser window by Jaden Geller. This is Helium3; it's a
forked project supporting multiple windows as documents, each with their own
settings as well as global preferences such as playlists and history, and
supporting multiple windows via a Finder status icon menu.

Helium3 as does Helium, allows you to watch media, browse the web and do much
more while you stay productive. Your content will never fall behind your other
windows even as you switch tasks.

Helium3 supports a customizable translucency mode that allows you to
simultaneously see your content and your work, without intercepting mouse
clicks when it's translucent.  You have the ability to click, drag, scroll
behind your floating content.

Head over to http://heliumfloats.com and install the latest version of Helium.
If you don't already allow apps from unidentified developers, you'll need to
right-click and choose "Open" the first time you use the app (instead of
opening the app with a single click).
